# Block Components

> Reusable components, hooks and helper functions for the WordPress block editor.


## Introduction

The Block Editor Components package provides reusable components, hooks and helper functions to use with the WordPress block editor.
This is **not** a WordPress plugin or other production-use library.
Instead, the package is intended to be used as development-time dependency, contributing to your plugin or project codebase build.

## Installation

The recommended way to use the Block Components package is to install as a node dependency.


```shell
npm install @meom/block-components
```
